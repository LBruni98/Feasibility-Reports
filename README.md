# Feasibility Reports

#### Purpose
A feasibility report is an analysis on how successfully a project can be completed. In this study, economic, legal, technological and scheduling factors would need to be addressed to ensure if the project is feasible overall. These studies are used by the project managers to determine the outcomes of said project before deciding whether that the project should be invested in or not. Feasibility studies also help with risk assessment as it allows for problems to be identified and solutions that could alleviate them, and can lead towards marketing strategies to help with the overall investment of the product.


#### Components
The components within a feasibility study are as followed:
Description of the product, with the layout and the deliverables

##### The Project Scope
This step defines the business problem that has to be addressed, being definitive and gets straight to the point. This scope also defines the parts of the business that would be affected directly or indirectly, including the participants of the project and the end-users. If well-defined, it can make for an accurate feasibility study, otherwise if the project starts without a well-defined scope, then budget and time could be an issue.

##### Market feasibility
This step examines the business environment where the product will be placed. Strengths and weaknesses from the current approach can be discovered here, as well as reviewing what is faced by a project in order to focus on the big picture, such as the strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats.

##### The Requirements
Two groups of requirements are key in this component; technical and organizational. If there is a potential and demand for the product, technical and resource requirements need to be identified. Depending on the objective of the project, the project managers have to identify the physical and economic resources for that product and failed projects and unfulfilled promises may come from understated resources.

##### The Approach
Next is the course of action to meet the requirements. At this point other solutions are compared here until the preferred one is chosen. Factors that come into play when finalizing the approach, such as does it meet the requirements and if it is a viable and practical solution.

##### Evaluation
Next is to examine the cost effectiveness for the approach and the total cost. The comparison of the other solutions does continue but mainly for estimation. After the total cost has been calculated, a return on investment is included in the evaluation and cost summary.

##### Review
Now all of the elements are assembled into the final study and a formal review is conducted. This review is used for the accuracy of the study and used to make the project decision. The review can still be revised or rejected at this point, but if approved, the parties sign the document and the solution is incorporated into the project.

#### Impact of feasibility

##### Technical
Technical feasibility is used to provide details on deliverables and what will be delivered. The deliverables may be either be shown as too ambitious or too lacking, they may be fine when described on the study but if the deliverables underachieve or need to be fixed. The clientâ€™s expectations of what could be could cause a lack of interest should the project be delivered with lacklustre deliverables. For example, a user interface should be upgraded onto a newer system.

##### Economic
Economic feasibility is the cost and time given to that project. The cost is more of an estimate rather than an exact amount, so throughout the project, there could be risks of the project delay or extended deadline, cutbacks, etc. and the overall project could be effected much to the dismay of the project manager. The project could effectively be altered to fit the newer resources and costs.

##### Organisational
Organisational Feasibility is the structure of the project that highlights on management of the project and the resources. The factors involved such as the skill of the development team could impact the overall design of the project or what resources are involved could change the perception of the project and this could change on how the project will be designed.
